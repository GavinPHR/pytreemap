.. module:: pytreemap

:py:mod:`pytreemap` is a Python implementation of Java TreeMap/TreeSet.
Most of the TreeMap/TreeSet APIs are implemented with some exceptions.
Please go to the :doc:`tree_map` section or :doc:`tree_set` section for
the full list of implemented APIs.

The underlying data structure is the Red-Black tree and
offers :math:`O(\text{log}\ n)` time complexity for
search (:meth:`get() <TreeMap.get>`), insert (:meth:`put() <TreeMap.put>`),
delete (:meth:`remove() <TreeMap.remove>`), and many other operations.

Same as Java TreeMap/TreeSet, this implementation is **NOT**
synchronized, you **MUST** do synchronization yourself in
multi-threaded applications.

The iterators returned by the TreeMap/TreeSet are *fail-fast*, meaning that
an exception is thrown **as soon as** a structural change to the TreeMap/TreeSet
is discovered.

.. NOTE::
   You should not rely on the *fail-fast* behaviour while testing
   your programs correctness. There is no guarantee that structural
   changes to the TreeMap/TreeSet are always caught.

Source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/GavinPHR/pytreemap>`_.
