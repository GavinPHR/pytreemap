# pytreemap
A Python implementation of the Java TreeMap.

## Alpha release now available on PyPI

Install with pip:

```bash
pip3 install pytreemap
```

Documentation is work-in-progress.
You can use Java 7's doc as a reference for now.
All the method names are lower_case_separated_by_underscore instead of mixedCase, e.g.
`containsKey()` in Java is `contains_key()` in this package.

Testing is work-in-progress as well. Proceed with care.
